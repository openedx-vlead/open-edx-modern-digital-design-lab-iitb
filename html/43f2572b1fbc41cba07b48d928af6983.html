<p>Introduction Laboratories play an important role in engineering education. The laboratory work provides an opportunity to witness classroom-learned theoretical concepts at work; operate instruments used in the experimental set-up; measure different quantities and thereafter analyze the experimental data; and work collaboratively. However, physical distances and the lack of resources make us unable to perform experiments, especially when they involve sophisticated instruments. Also, trained teachers are always a scarce resource. Rapid development and ever increasing use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has revolutionized the education system by eliminating limitations in terms of physical distance, time and access, by providing equal opportunity to everyone, irrespective of place and time. As a part of e-Prayog, the following electronics lab courses have been developed: Electronic Devices and Circuits Network Analysis Linear Integrated Circuits Signals and Systems Digital Signal Processing using DSK6713,DSK5510 and a low cost board using TMS320vc33 Modern Digital Design using CPLD and FPGA Microcontrollers Image Processing These are purely simulation based labs. Users are not required to book the slots. $ These are low-cost kit-based labs.</p>
