<pre><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">BCD or Binary Coded Decimal is that number system or code which has the binary numbers or digits to represent a decimal number. A decimal number contains 10 digits (0-9). Now the equivalent binary numbers can be found out of these 10 decimal numbers. In case of BCD the binary number formed by four binary digits, will be the equivalent code for the given decimal digits. In  BCD we can use the binary number from 0000-1001 only, which are the decimal equivalent from 0-9 respectively.  Suppose if a number have single decimal digit then it&rsquo;s equivalent  Binary Coded Decimal will be the respective four binary digits of that decimal number and if the number contains two decimal digits then it&rsquo;s equivalent BCD  will be the respective eight binary of the given decimal number.
