<pre>Half adder can be used to add two one bit binary numbers. It is also possible to create a logical circuit using multiple full adders to add N-bit binary numbers. Each full adders inputs a Cin, which is the Cout of the previous order. This kind of adder is a Ripple Carry Adder, since eachcarry bit ripples to the next full adder.A combinational circuit that performs the addition of three bits is called Full adder. It consists  of three input and two output. The output variables produce the sum and carry. A multi-bit binary adder can be constructed using a cascade of full adders.We connect the output carry port &lsquo;cout&rsquo; of each full-adder to the input port &lsquo;cin&rsquo;, of the next full adder.</pre>
