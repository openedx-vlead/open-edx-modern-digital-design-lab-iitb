<pre><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A ring counter is a Shift Register  with the output of the last flip flop connected to the input of the first. It is initialized such that only one of the flip flop output is 1 while the remainder is 0. The 1 bit is circulated so the state repeats every n clock cycles if n flip-flops are used. The "MOD" or "MODULUS" of a counter is the number of unique states. The MOD of the n flip flop ring counter is n.

It can be implemented using D-type flip-flops (or JK-type flip-flops).</span></pre>
