<p>1. Develop fairly using pen and paper the truth table for all combinations of 2 bit half adder with inputs as A and B, and outputs as Sum and Carry.</p>
<p>2. Reduce the Sum and Carry outputs using K-Map.</p>
<p>3. Similarly repeat 1 and 2 for full adder with inputs as A, B and CarryIn and output as Sum and CarryOut.</p>
<p>4. Draw a block schematic of 8-bit full adder.</p>
