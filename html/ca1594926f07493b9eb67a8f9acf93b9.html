<pre><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The memory elements in a sequential circuit are called flip-flops. A flip-flop circuit has two outputs, one for the normal value and one for the complement value of the stored bit. A flip-flop circuit can be constructed from two NAND gates or two NOR gates.
