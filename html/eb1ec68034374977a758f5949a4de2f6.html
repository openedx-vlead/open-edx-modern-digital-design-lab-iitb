<p>To Design, implement and Simulate 8-bit full adder. Objective:-</p>
<p>1. Understanding moduler structual design of any bit adder using half adder and full adder modules.</p>
<p>2. Using the above half adder design a full adder such that 2 bits are added along with previous carry and results are given as sum and carry.</p>
<p>3. Design a structural 8 bit full adder using the above 1 bit full adder.</p>
