<pre><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">We need to build an FSM that would detect the pattern 101 that has arrived over past 3 clock cycles, one bit a time, over a single bit input port. The recognition should be indicated by asserting a single bit output signal HIGH over the clock cycle immediately after noticing the above 3-bit sequence.</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
The circuit has one input, w, and one output, y. We assume that the input `w' changes at most once during a clock cycle ( assuming posedge triggered clock, the clock cycle duration between successive posedges of the clock ). By the value of `w' in a clock cycle we mean the value of `w' that has stabilized prior to the posedge of the clock, at the end of the clock signal. Let's assume that setup/hold time requirements are met by the input `w' with respect to the clock signal.

Let us also assume that all the updates of the synchronous memory elements in the logic circuit occur on the positive edge of a clock signal. The output y is asserted-HIGH if over 3 immediately preceding clock cycles the single bit input `w' was equal to 101 ( i.e. w=1 at the end of third previous clock cycle, 0 at the end of second previous clock cycle, 1 at the end of the just concluded clock cycle) . Otherwise, the value of output y is equal to 0 ( i.e. y. is deasserted LOW ).

Clearly the circuit needs to have memory as the output y cannot depend solely on the present value of w
