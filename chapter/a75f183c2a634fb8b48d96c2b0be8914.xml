<chapter display_name="To Design, implement and Simulate 8-bit full adder.        Objective:-                 1. Understanding moduler structual design of any bit adder using half adder and full adder modules.           2. Using the above half adder design a full adder such that 2 bits are added along with previous carry and results are given as sum and carry.              3. Design a structural 8 bit full adder using the above 1 bit full adder">
